# Notes to my self :D

Well, as it is a personal project, I'm writing the hell I'm doing to get some reference to future projects.

To learn the basics, I'm using a little of the Linux Kernel Guide and the 'Linux Device Drivers Development Course for Beginners' from freecodecamp.org. So, to be following the course, I've installed the canonical-multipass (it were meant to be on AUR, but seems its not updated for a while, so I've installed snapd, and installed the multipass from the snap pkg).
ps: Well, probably it was mt fault, but multipass works so poorly that I'm making an actual VM with qemu :p

Instead of installing snapd I should've use just a normal VM? Maybe. But I'll try to follow fr the tutorial, at least once in my life :D

## Getting Started

1. install canonical-multipass as my virtual enviroment.
2. configure the ssh to be able to recieve the KDE interactive auth, restart the service and set a passwd
3. Connect via ssh to this VM (using vscode with microsft remote development extension is kinda good, but use nvim into the virtual env works as the same)

btw, I invested some time into understanding VM to a point my entire time was spend on that. I'll be pushing this project by now to save it for later.
